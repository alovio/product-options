/**
 * The header's support affordance, and the only thing that speaks for it.
 *
 * It replaced a "Try Alovio Calculator" cross-promo. That link asked the user
 * for something (go look at another product) on a screen where they came to do
 * work. This asks for nothing until clicked, and what it opens leads with the
 * promise rather than the request: the plugin is free and stays free, and
 * a review costs nothing if money isn't on the table.
 *
 * Modal comes from @wordpress/components so focus trapping, ESC and the aria
 * wiring are wp-admin's, not a hand-rolled dialog's.
